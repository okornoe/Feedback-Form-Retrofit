This app implments the idea of sending data to a google spreadsheet WITHOUT the use of the Spreadsheet API but by using the retrofit library to send simple POST calls.  

## Getting Started

This is a simple feedback application and the "Smiley Rating" library developed by sujithkanna is used to create animated smileys. A link to the library is provided at the credits section. 

## Android Goodies
### Components used

* Retrofit
